# Settinguptheshell

This repo is both a location for notes on my shell setup and also a repo to hold the pertinent files. When installing, symlink the repo files to their pertinent locations.

> ln -s <repo clone dir>/.vim ~/.vim
> ln -s <repo clone dir>/.vimrc ~/vimrc

I've setup Vundle and use it to corral the other additions.
Check out the vimrc and browse the bundle directory to see what's installed.
I've included the following color schemes:
peaksea
twilight
candy
solarized

Also have vim-airline installed.
